#' @description
#' MS-GOP is a machine learning algorithm for merging satellite-based and ground precipitation data.
#' It combines Random Forest for spatial prediction, residual modeling for bias correction, and quantile mapping for final adjustment, ensuring accurate precipitation estimates across different temporal scales
