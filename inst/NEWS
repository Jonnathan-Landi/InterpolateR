### New Features

- The ordinary kriging method has been added.
- The entire Cressman algorithm code has been refactored, which has accelerated its execution speed.
- The “n_round” functionality has been added to the Cressman algorithm, which allows the final layers to be rounded.
- The IDW algorithm has been redesigned, ensuring faster execution time and resource consumption.
- A new parameter called “mask” has been added to the IDW algorithm, allowing the final file to be cropped and masked based on the input polygon.
- The Altitude “Z” parameter is no longer required when running IDW or Cressman.

### Bug Fixed

- An error that occurred if the “Z” column was not passed in BD_Coords when it was not mandatory has been corrected.
- Typos in the IDW documentation have been corrected.
